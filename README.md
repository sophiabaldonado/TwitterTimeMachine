# Spring Break Project

**A twitter time machine.**

You choose how many hours in the future or past you want to travel and with the click of a button it provides you a fresh tweet (or multiple tweets) from people in another timezone, preferable a popular tweet or one that mentions keywords around what time it is for them. Maybe also provides other info about their location like the weather there if they provided that. Maybe use oauth to sign in through twitter and like or retweet, creepily.

**Learning Goals & Other Stuff**

Explore using new APIs in interesting ways. Learn more about RESTful APIs and how to interact with them and if I create an API it should be RESTful. I would like to test _thoroughly_ as I build the app because I think thatâ€™s a weak spot for me historically. I will use Rails for development. It will be a simple consumer for the twitter and other APIs that should be accessible through a browser, deployed on Heroku, and have a great user experience, should also be like pretty or whatever. I want 95% test coverage of models/controllers/lib Target audience is basically anyone who's bored on the internet. 'Success is measured in understanding' -- _Jillian_
